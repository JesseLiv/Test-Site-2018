    <p>Sometimes we are required to write things that don't really matter.</p>
    <p>Some of these things might include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hot Dogs</li>
      <li>Lists</li>
      <li>Some other stuff</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With all of this stuff going on, someone should really do something about it all.</p>
    <br><br>
